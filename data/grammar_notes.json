        "explanation": "In Spanish, all nouns have a gender (masculine or feminine). The definite articles are 'el' (masculine singular), 'la' (feminine singular), 'los' (masculine plural), and 'las' (feminine plural).",

          "Most nouns ending in -o are masculine (el libro, el plato).",

        "difficulty": "beginner",
